# 4Bit_ALU
# 4-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

## 📜 Overview
This project implements a **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** in Verilog.  
An ALU is a fundamental building block of a CPU that performs arithmetic and logic operations.  
This ALU supports a set of operations including addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR for 4-bit inputs.
